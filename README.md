EVA is for intro programming courses. It helps students understand the mechanics of a computer. EVA shows how a VBA program runs, and how it changes the CPU, memory, and worksheet.

Four sample visualizations are included. 

EVA is written in JavaScript, and is designed to be embedded in a Web page. See https://programming.cybercour.se to see it in the wild.
