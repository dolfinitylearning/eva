# Excel VBA program animator

EVA is for intro programming courses. It helps students understand the 
mechanics of a computer. EVA shows how a VBA program runs, and how it changes the CPU, memory, and worksheet.

Four sample visualizations are included. 

EVA is written in JavaScript, and is designed to be embedded in a Web page. 
See https://programming.cybercour.se to see it in the wild.

Note: you need to load the samples from a Web server (e.g., Apache), rather 
than loading the files directly into a browser.
